# Clustering

## Overview

Welcome to the "Clustering" repository! This repository contains various machine learning clustering analyses. It showcases different algorithms applied to clustering problems, including but not limited to K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models, and more.

## Code Examples

### Loading and Preprocessing Data

The code examples in this repository include data loading, preprocessing, and transformation steps such as feature scaling and encoding.

### Model Implementation

Each clustering algorithm is implemented in its respective script or Jupyter notebook, demonstrating:

- **Training**: How to apply the clustering algorithm to the dataset.
- **Parameter Tuning**: Techniques for choosing optimal parameters or evaluating clustering performance.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics and visualizations to assess clustering performance, such as Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and clustering visualizations.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Clustering.git
   cd Clustering
   
2. **Install Dependencies**

    Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install <required libraries>

3. **Run the Notebooks/Scripts**

    Open the Jupyter notebooks or run the Python scripts to execute the regression analyses.

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook

4. **Visualize Results**

    The results, including performance metrics and visualizations, can be found in the respective notebooks or scripts.
